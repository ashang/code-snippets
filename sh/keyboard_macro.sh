# keyboard_macro [-r] "string"|-
#
# Inject a keyboard macro string into my X windows input stream
# either by reading from standard input, or as a command line argument
#
# OPTIONS
#    -r  add a final newline (or Return key) to the typed string
#
# EXAMPLES
#
# My Email Address
#   keyboard_macro "A.Thyssen@griffith.edu.au"
#
# My Public Web Site
#   keyboard_macro "http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/"
#
# Grab my current text selection it clipboard (when Ctrl-C doesn't work)
#   sh -c 'xsel -p | xsel -i -b'
#
# Paste the clipboard into ANY input window (when Ctrl-V doesn't work)
#   sh -c 'xsel -b | keyboard_macro -
#
####
#
# Note: that I sometimes include a 1/2 second delay before the macro is 'typed'
# so that any modifiers the user has used to initiate the keyboard macro has
# been released.  Or I try to 'keyup' those modifier keys.
